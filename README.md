# Facial Recognition Case Study
Using a CNN Model to identify Your Photos Among Celebrity Images 

Welcome to the Facial Recognition Case Study. In this project you will build a complete image based machine learning pipeline that trains a model to recognize your photos. You will combine your own images with a large celebrity dataset, prepare the data, explore it, clean it, and then train a convolutional neural network that learns to separate your class from the celebrity class.

## 1. Download Celebrity Dataset
Go to the data instructions file in the data folder. It explains how to download the celebrity dataset and where to get it.
After you download the dataset, upload the entire folder to your Google Drive.

## 2. Collect Group Member Images
Gather 25 pictures of each group member.
Upload these pictures to a separate folder in your Google Drive.
Make sure the photos show the face clearly and are not blurry.
